# Hexpress :rocket:

Meet *Hexpess*, your very own, *very minimal* version of Express.

We have been using Express to build many apps, now it's time to pull aside the curtain
and understand what Express is doing behind the scenes. :star2:

## Outline

1. Part 1: `app.listen(port)` and `app.get(url, callback)`

    Also support `req` and `res` inside route `callback` with
    1. `req.query`
    1. `res.send()`
    1. `res.json`
1. Part 2: `app.post(url, callback)`
1. Part 3: `app.use(routePrefix, callback)`
1. Part 4: `res.render(name, options)`
1. Part 5: `req.params`
1. (Bonus) Part 6: `next()` inside route
1. (Double Bonus) Part 7: `res.render()` with Layouts

    We will use [`handlebars`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars) for templating (when we build `res.render()`). Let's get started!

## [`http`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)

The primary purpose of Express is to listen for and respond to incoming HTTP
requests. We're going to use the Node built-in library `http` to assist
us in this task.

The `http` library can be accessed via, `require('http')`. You do **not** need
to `npm install` it.

Here are the parts of the `http` library we need:

1. [`http.createServer([requestListener])`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server)

    Creates a new [`server`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server)
    that will call `requestListener` when it receives a request.

    `requestListener` is function that takes two arguments `req` and `res`.
    1. `req` is an [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object. It has:

        - `req.url`: the full URL of the request including query string.

        - `req.method`: the HTTP method of the request.

    1. `res` is an
  [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) object. It has:

        - `res.writeHead(statusCode, headersObject)`: Sets the status code and headers
        for the response. The `headersObject` is an object where header names are
        keys and header values are values.

        - `res.end(body)`: Send the response body and terminate the request. `body` is a string that contains the whole response body.
1. [`http.Server.listen(port)`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_listen_port_hostname_backlog_callback)

    Begin accepting connections on the specified port.

## Part 1: `.listen(port)` and `.get(url, callback)`

Open `hexpress/hexpress.js`.

You will need to implement the `hexpress` function which creates a new `hexpress` application when called. (just like `var app = express()`) This application will have two methods:

1. `.get(url, callback)`: add a new endpoint that listens to `GET`
requests where the URL is exactly `url` (excluding the query string).

    If multiple endpoints have the same method and URL, **only** call the one
    that is registered first. The rest should be ignored.

    When a `GET` request with a matching URL is received, call `callback` with
    `req` and `res`:

    1. `req.query` is an object that maps query parameters to values.

        **Use:** `req.url` and the Node built-in
        [`querystring`](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html)
        library to parse the part of the URL after the question mark `?`.

    1. `res.send(string)` is a function that sets the header `Content-Type` to `text/plain`, the status code to `200`, and sends a `string` back as the response body.

        **Use:** `res.writeHead()` and `res.end()`

    1. `res.json(obj)` is a function that sets the header `Content-Type` to
    `application/json`, the status code to `200`, and sends
    `JSON.stringify(obj)` back as the response body.

        **Use:** `res.writeHead()` and `res.end()`
1. `.listen(port)`: begin accepting connections on the specified port.

    **Use:** `http.Server.listen()`

### Verification

Run `node part1.js` and verify that all routes in `part1.js` work correctly. Read the comments in `part1.js`, they specify the expected behavior of all routes.

`GET /query` should parse the whole query string (something like the following):

![Part 1 goal screenshot](img/req_query.png)

## Part 2: `.post(url, callback)`

Continue work on `hexpress/hexpress.js`. Add the `.post()` method:

1. `.post(url, callback)`: add a new endpoint that listens to `POST`
requests where the URL is exactly `url` (excluding the query string).

    If multiple endpoints have the same method and URL, **only** call the one
    that is registered first. The rest should be ignored.

    When a `POST` request with a matching URL is received, call `callback` with
    `req` and `res`:

    1. `req.body` is an object that holds all data in the `POST` body. Usually
    we use `body-parser` for this task, but we can't do that here because we
    haven't implemented middleware.

        **Use:** The following code snippet will help you get the request body. You should replace `YOUR-CALLBACK` with a function call to your route's callback function.

        ```javascript
        var body = '';
        req.on('readable', function() {
            var chunk = req.read();
            if (chunk) body += chunk;
        });
        req.on('end', function() {
            // queryString is the querystring node built-in
            req.body = queryString.parse(body);
            // TODO: YOUR-CALLBACK
        });
        ```

### Verification

Run `node part2.js` and verify that all routes in `part2.js` work correctly. Read the comments in `part2.js`, they specify the expected behavior of all routes.

## Part 3: `.use(routePrefix, callback)`

Continue work on `hexpress/hexpress.js`. Add the `.use()` method to `app`:

1. `.use(routePrefix, callback)`: Add a route that matches any request method
with the given `routePrefix`. The route will match any incoming request where
the URL starts with `routePrefix`.

    For example: `app.use('/apple', ...)` will match `/apple`, `/apple/images`,
    `/apple/images/news`, and so on.

    If no path is specified the callback function should run for every request.

### Verification

Run `node part3.js` and verify that all routes in `part3.js` work correctly. Read the comments in `part3.js`, they specify the expected behavior of all routes.

## Part 4: `res.render(name, options)`

Continue work on `hexpress/hexpress.js`. Add the `.render()` method to `res`:

1. `.render(name, options)`: add a new method that, given a file path (to a `.hbs` file), will read the file and and generate HTML. Then it will send that HTML back as the response.

    Assume that all `.hbs` files are located in a folder named `views`

    1. Set the `Content-Type` header to `text/html`, the status code to `200`.
    1. Convert the `.hbs` to HTML

        **Use:** The [`handlebars`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars)
        `npm` package to convert the `.hbs` into HTML

        ```javascript
        // Read from file here
        var hbs = "<p>Hello, my name is {{name}}. I am from {{hometown}}</p>"
        var template = Handlebars.compile(hbs);

        var data = { "name": "Alan", "hometown": "Somewhere, TX"};
        console.log(template(data));
        // Outputs:"<p>Hello, my name is Alan. I am from Somewhere, TX.</p>"
        ```

    1. Send a `html` string through `res.end()`


### Verification

Run `node part4.js` and verify that all routes in `part4.js` work correctly. Read the comments in `part4.js`, they specify the expected behavior of all routes.

## Part 5: `req.params`

Continue work on `hexpress/hexpress.js`. Add compatibility for using params to `req`:

1. `req.params`

    Implement a way to go through the `req.url` and create an object that
    contains all params defined by your route

    For example, given the route `app.get("/:name")` a `GET` request to `/prath`
    should set `req.params` to be `{'name': 'prath'}`).

### Verification

Run `node part5.js` and verify that all routes in `part5.js` work
correctly. Read the comments in `part5.js`, they specify the expected
behavior of all routes.

## Bonus Part 6: `next()` inside route

The `next` method passes control to the next **matching** route. Implement
functionality for the use of the `next()` function.

### Verification

Run `node part6.js` and verify that all routes in `part6.js` work correctly. Read the comments in `part6.js`, they specify the expected behavior of all routes.

## Double Bonus Part 7: `res.render()` with Layouts

Edit your `res.render()` to account for the use of layouts.

If there is a file named `main.hbs` in the `views/layouts` folder, automatically
wrap all inner templates inside `main.hbs`.

You can assume `main.hbs` takes a template variable `body`.
